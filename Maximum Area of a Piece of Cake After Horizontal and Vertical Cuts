/*
1. sort the hCuts and vCuts
2. now the task is just to find the max diff b/w all cuts, so start with 0, then compare internal cut, and at last check for the last index and the len of the cake
3. this how you will get the max diff we will do the same for vcuts as well
4. now to get the biggest area just multiply the max diff of vertical and horizontal together
